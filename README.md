# MachineLearning
I will be working through Andriy Burkov's "The Hundred Page Machine Learning Book" and testing/experimenting with exercises from the book and on my own in this repo.

I will also be making a Github Pages site for this repo using Jupyter Notebooks to embed code with formatted MarkDown.
